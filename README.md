# cursor_controller_using_eye_tracking
Overview

The Cursor Controller using Eye Tracking project is a Python-based application that leverages eye-tracking technology to control the computer cursor. The project utilizes popular Python libraries such as MediaPipe, OpenCV (cv2), and PyAutoGUI to track eye movements and translate them into cursor movements. This innovative approach offers an alternative input method for users, providing accessibility and convenience.

Features

- Real-Time Eye Tracking: Uses MediaPipe to detect and track eye movements in real time.
- Cursor Control: Translates eye movements into corresponding cursor movements using PyAutoGUI.
- Customizable Settings: Allows users to customize sensitivity and other parameters for optimal performance.
- Open Source: Fully open-source and available for contributions and improvements.

Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
